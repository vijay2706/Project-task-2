## X-Y Plotter:
**Common specifications of X-Y Plotter**
- The size of the plotter is approx. 500x400x130mm and it engraves an area 280x200mm.(approx.)
- Working Accuracy is 0.01mm.
- The chess board should be in same dimensions of plotter, since the size of ploter is fixed.
- This X-Y plotter is 2D plotter.And it uses a special mechanism to raise the pen.It is shown in (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiwWCrCfXrY)[vidoe].
Microcontroller: Arduino

How to make it ourselves?
Here is the tutorial for the same.(https://github.com/MertArduino/Make-Arduino-XY-Plotter-Drawing-Robot)
Instead of pen we can attach a magnet.

## Resistive touch panel
- These touch panels give the coordinates where the panel is being touched.
- There is no restriction for the chess peices, so chess pieces can be made with any material.
- These panels work on the basis of pressure applied.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv7gGdeRXwc)[video].
- This is the prototype of the resistive multi-touch pad.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7eQ2LHzYMQ)[video].
